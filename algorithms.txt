Algorithms for each step:

## getComputerChoice function:
- generate a random number from 1 - 10
- if the number is less than 4, return "rock"
- if the number is or between 4 and 7, return "paper"
- otherwise, return "scissors"

## getHumanChoice function
- promt user for input (give out clear choices)
- return that input

## player score variables
- create variables for human and computer score
- their initial values are both 0

## playRound function
- accept two parameters: humanChoice and getComputerChoice
- make parameters case insensitive
- nest if else statements for the logic of the game (too much to put here)
- display the result
- increment human/computer score depending on the winner

## playGame function
- call playRound 5 times
- compare scores and display winner
